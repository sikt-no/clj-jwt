# clj-jwt

A Clojure library to handle validation of JWTs.

The library exposes functions to handle validation of JSON web tokens. It wraps
some of [Buddy's](https://funcool.github.io/buddy-sign/latest/) jwt signature
handling functions and uses a JWKS endpoint to fetch the public keys to use for
signature validation.
